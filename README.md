# Machine Learning with Python

In the Machine Learning with Python, I will use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning

I will also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.
